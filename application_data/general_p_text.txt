This application is designed to visualise clerics data using several R packages. There are two tabs dedicated to the network representation: “Nodal Degree” and “Time Frame”. 

The first one is designed to subset the data based on the nodal degree measure. Nodal degree refers to the number of nodes that are adjacent to a particular node. Note that nodes are sometimes called vertices. Nodal degree are simple and relatively easy to calculate. However, it is a very informative measure in social network theory since it allows us to understand how active a given node is. In another words, the higher nodal degree of a particular vertex (where each vertex represent a unique priest), the more connections the person had. 

It should be mentioned that for the purposes of  representation a vast amount of data, it was decided that only part of the data can be selected in the Nodal Degree tab. 

After selecting the percentage of the data you will be presented with the most common graph statistics:

Density:
This measure is used to understand how ____. It is calculated as number of existing connections (edges) divided by the number of all possible connections in the graph. It ranges from 0 (no ties exist) to 1 (all possible ties exist).

Clustering coefficient:

Mean distance: 


Diameter:
