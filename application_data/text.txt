This application is designed to visualise clerics data using several R packages. There are several tabs, each dedicated to a specific measure, on which data is subsetted.

There are two measures: Nodal degree and Centrality degree. 

Nodal degree refers to the number of nodes that are adjacent to a particular node. Nodes are also called vertices. 
Nodal degree are simple and easy to calculate, yet it is a very informative measure in social network theory. Nodal degree allows us to understand how well-connected a given node is. 

 5% - 6.8% (85+ degrees)
10% - 10.1% (81+ degrees)
15% - 15.4% (78+ degrees)
20% - 21.5% (73+ degrees)
25% - 25.07% (70+ degrees)
